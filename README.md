## A script focused on analyzing all possible vulnerabilities in a site from  

scripts that we will use here:

- [x] nikto
- [x] dalfox
- [x] nuclei
- [x] rapidscan
- [x] subfinder
- [x] gf
- [x] VulnX
- [x] paramspider

## usage:
```bash
bash Black_widow.sh url(without https://) -all
```

-  -all = **install all tools for run the script(opcional)** 

NOTE: it is necessary that you install the gf and have inside
the .gf folder the xss extension to work properly.


NOTE: all the tools I use are already in cry_of_roses.

NOTE: this script need to install in root for run.
