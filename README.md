A script focused on analyzing all possible vulnerabilities in a site from 
 8 tools 

scripts that we will use here:
-sniper
-nikto
-dalfox
-nuclei
-rapidscan
-subfinder
-gf
-VulnX
-paramspider
-wfuzz

usage:
bash Black_widow.sh url(without https://) -all

-all = install all tools for run the script(opcional) 

NOTE: it is necessary that you install the gf and have inside
the .gf folder the xss extension to work properly.


NOTE: all the tools I use are already in cry_of_roses.

NOTE: this script need to install in root for run.
